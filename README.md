This website was made using HTML, CSS, React and JavaScript. 


Future enhancements:

• I want to set up Styled Components where possible instead of using css.
• Work out a form validation system that doesn't show blank when you don't have anything in the input.
• design out the star wars module and add more information from the api
• add testing components
• Get the active class to work on the list items
• figure out why the API is so slow (probably the way I'm fetching the information).
